== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= I'm not seeing as many options on my settings page as your screenshot =
You're most likely using a WooThemes theme. WooTheme themes disable the WooCommerce breadcrumbs in favour of the WooFramework Breadcrumbs and unfortunately there aren't as many options that can be configured.

= Can I disable the WooCommerce breadcrumbs? =
Certainly! On the settings page, simply untick the 'Enable breadcrumbs' checkbox and save your settings.
