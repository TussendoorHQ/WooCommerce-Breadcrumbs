A simple plugin to style the WooCommerce Breadcrumbs or disable them altogether

== Description ==

WooCommerce Breadcrumbs is a simple WordPress plugin that gives you the ability to restyle the WooCommerce breadcrumbs. It also gives you the ability to disable them completely so they longer display.

By changing the html surrounding your breadcrumbs, you're able to style your breadcrumbs in different ways. For example, the default breadcrumbs simply display links with a seperator character. Using WooCommerce Breadcrumbs, you can change them to display as an unsorted listed of links instead.

WooCommerce Breadcrumbs gives you the following settings:

Breadcrumb Delimiter - This is the delimeter to use between each breadcrumb
Wrap before - The opening html tag to wrap before all your breadcrumbs
Wrap after - The closing html tag to wrap after all your breadcrumbs
Before - The opening html tag to wrap before each individual breadcrumb
After - The closing html tag to wrap after each individual breadcrumb
Home text - The text to use for the ‘Home’ breadcrumb
Home URL - The URL that the ‘Home’ breadcrumb links to

If need be, you can also disable the breadcrumbs completely by unticking the 'Enable breadcrumbs' checkbox. This will stop the breadcrumbs from displaying on your site.

If you notice there are a few less breadcrumb options on the settings page than you expected, then you're mostly likely using a WooThemes Theme. WooTheme themes disable the WooCommerce breadcrumbs in favour of the WooFramework Breadcrumbs. The downside to this is that there aren't quite as many options that can be changed with the WooFramework Breadcrumbs.


== Installation ==

1. Upload the 'woocommerce-breadcrumbs' folder to your '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to the 'Settings > WC Breadcrumbs' menu to update the plugin settings


== Frequently Asked Questions ==
